**TEXT FILE TO VIDEO CONVERTER AND DECODER**

This is a simple project of file handling and byte manipulation using Java and openCV.
The code takes the text file (with .txt extension) and convert the file into .avi video file which on display shows noise.
We can further decode this video file to convert back .avi to .txt with lossless decoding.

**PURPOSE**
The main purpose for this application program is free space. Many video streaming sites like Youtube provide unlimited storage for video upload. We can convert text file into video and upload the same privately. On need we can download the file and decode it to get original document.


**This is initial version of app and may contain errors and exceptions. Currently the program only supports .txt file and will integrate .pdf version in future.**
